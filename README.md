## About The Project
### Introduction
The Basketball Players dataset has been taken for visualization such that Free Throws can be observed using various factors. Supporting dataset of Players Goals, Free Throw Attempts, Salary, Games, Minutes Played, Field Goals, Field Goal Attempts, Point and Seasons was also taken to provide deep insights using visualized graphs. 
The aim for creating different visualizations was to study 
* Free Throws Attempts Per Game.
* Free Throws per Free Throws Attempts
* Accuracy of Free Throws
* Player Playing Style (excluding Free Throws)
